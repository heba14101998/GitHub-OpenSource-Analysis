# Egyptian Open Source Contribution Analysis
---

This project aims to analyze and visualize open source contributions from Egypt, with a specific focus on the Arabic-speaking open source community. By understanding the trends and patterns within Egyptian open source projects, we hope to:

* **Empower Arabic developers:** Provide valuable insights into the Egyptian open source ecosystem, helping developers identify popular technologies, active communities, and potential collaborators.
* **Promote collaboration:**  Foster a stronger sense of community by highlighting the most active projects and developers, encouraging participation and knowledge sharing.
* **Support Arabic language adoption:**  Demonstrate the growing adoption of Arabic in open source development, encouraging more Arabic-speaking developers to contribute.

### **Project Objectives:**

1. **Data Collection and Quality:**
    * Source reliable data from GitHub.
    * Ensure completeness and accuracy of data.
    * Exclude inactive or low-quality projects.

2. **Data Analysis and Visualization:**
    * Analyze the geographic distribution of contributors.
    * Identify the most popular programming languages and projects.
    * Understand the top industries and technologies being developed.
    * Analyze the use of frameworks and libraries within Egyptian projects.

3. **Tooling and Automation:**
    * Use Python and relevant libraries for data processing and visualization.
    * Automate data collection where possible to ensure repeatability.

4. **Reporting and Documentation:**
    * Clearly document methodologies, data sources, and limitations.
    * Provide transparent and reproducible analysis results.

### **Project Structure:**

The project consists of several Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a specific analysis task:

* **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Collects data from GitHub, cleanses it, and prepares it for analysis.
* **Contributor Location Analysis:** Analyzes the geographic distribution of contributors by Egyptian city or area.
* **Top Programming Languages Analysis:**  Identifies the most popular programming languages used in Egyptian open source projects.
* **Top Projects Analysis:**  Identifies the most popular and active open source projects from Egypt.
* **Non-Egyptian Projects with Egyptian Contributors:** Identifies non-Egyptian projects with significant contributions from Egyptian developers.
* **Top Industries/Topics Analysis:**  Identifies the top industries or topics covered by Egyptian open source projects.
* **Top Frameworks and Libraries Analysis:**  Identifies the most frequently used frameworks and libraries in Egyptian projects.
